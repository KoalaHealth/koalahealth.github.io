    <p>
    We created Koala Health to bring you high-quality, family-friendly apps for free or as close as possible.  To keep things accessible to you, we work with wonderful partners and affiliates that align with our goals and promote products we think you will want.  We want to always be real with you, so we will point out sponsored ads and placements, whenever possible (we sometimes have to display certain ads exactly to agreements and regulations).  A formal disclosure is required and posted below.

    <h4>FORMAL ADVERTISING DISCLOSURE</h4>
    <p>
    Koala Health is an advertising-supported software publishing company.  The offers that appear on this site and Koala Health apps may be companies from which Koala Health receives compensation.  This compensation may impact how and where products appear on this site (including, for example, the order in which they appear).  Koala Health does not include all companies or all offers available through its affiliates and partners.  Koala Health may use other proprietary factors to impact offer listings, such as consumer selection or the likelihood of the applicantâ€™s credit approval.
