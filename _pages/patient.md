    <h1>What We Do For Patients</h1>
    
    <p>At Koala Health, we want to support a healthier community.  A healthier community keeps your neighbors, friends, and families healthy (not to mention you)!  Germs don't discriminate, so we fight sickness by sharing our knowledge with you!</p>
    <p>Our general health care professionals volunteer their time to share their experience and answer ANY general questions you have (except medical - sorry but we can't by law).  Of course, call 911 if you are having an emergency.</p>
    <p>Not sure how to check your medical coverage?  We will help!<br />Not sure how to navigate your care?  We will share what we know!</p>

    <h3>What Else?</h3>
    <p>We also develop high-quality health care apps and devices that promote and support your health.</p>
