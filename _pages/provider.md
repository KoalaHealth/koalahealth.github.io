    <h1>What We Do For Health Care Providers</h1>
    <h3>Mission</h3>
    <p>Our mission at Koala Health is to provide high-quality, cutting-edge technologies that are approachable to experienced health care providers.</p>

    <h3>For Our Partners</h3>
    <p>As "battle-worn" health care providers, many of us wanted to start our own practices, but we did not have the resources or could not afford the best EHRs, medical devices, and staff.  To leave a stronger healthcare system for our families and friends, we created Koala Health.</p>
    <p>Koala Health will help private practices and clinics lower the cost of starting and controlling clinic costs and spend - for free (if there are any charged fees, these will be offered with transparency).</p>
    <p>It is difficult to know which EHRs and software to use.  We will provide advice and advocate for you to build favorable partnerships with healthcare companies.  Though we cannot provide guarantees of successful partnerships, we will connect you with the right people in industry to increase the success of your practice.</p>

    <h3>We Believe</h3>
    <p>We believe the key to better primary care is in private practice.</p>
