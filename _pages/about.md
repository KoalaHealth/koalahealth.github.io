    <h1>About Koala Health</h1>
    <h3>Mission</h3>
    <p>Our mission at Koala Health is to provide high-quality, family-friendly apps and products for everyone</p>
    <p>We try to make our high-quality apps available free or at near cost of production.</p>

    <h3>We Believe</h3>
    <p>We believe apps should only collect information that is required for function and privacy.  Koala Health only receives information you share.  We will not sell your personal identifiable information, so company will never know who you are.</p>

    <p>But remember, if you are using a baby log tracking app (Soothe App), we have no choice but to collect your information, so you can login, identify your children, and know which log entries relate to your children.  In other words, we will safely store personal information you share with us.</p>
