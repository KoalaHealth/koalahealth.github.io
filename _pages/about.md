    <h1>About Koala Health</h1>
    <h3>Mission</h3>

    <p>Our mission at Koala Health is to provide high-quality, family-friendly apps and products for everyone.</p>

    <p>We try to make our high-quality apps available free, whenever possible.</p>

    <h3>We Believe</h3>
    <p>We believe apps should only collect information that is required for function and privacy.</p>
    <p>This often means:</p>
    <ul style="font-size: 24px;">
    <li>For apps that don't need to connect to the internet for information, your data stays on your device(s).</li>
    <li>If you sync data between devices, your data will rely on your devices' synching mechanism (like iCloud for Apple devices).</li>
    <li>Koala Health only receives information you share with us, so the company <u>does not know who you are</u> unless you share it with us.</li>
    <li>Whenever there are ads, we even limit tracking by our ad managing partners in our apps, as we can.  We recommend increasing privacy by setting your devices' privacy settings (e.g. https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/04/26/iphone-ask-app-not-to-track-ios-update/)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You rely on trustworthy app makers.  We work very hard to operate as one.  Don't trust us blindly.  If you are technical/engineer, please test our products and share with us, if we need to improve.</p>

    <p>We look forward to building mutual trust with you through our products over time!</p>
