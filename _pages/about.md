    <h1>About Koala Health</h1>
    <h3>Mission</h3>
    <p>Our mission at Koala Health is to provide high-quality, cutting-edge technologies that are approachable to experienced health care providers.</p>

    <h3>We Are</h3>
    <p>Caught between the struggle to provide the best patient care that the U.S. can offer and the insanely high costs of even the most basic medical devices, Koala Health was started by our healthcare provider-engineer founder.</p>
    <p>We are "battle-worn" health care professionals and engineers trained at some of the top institutitons in the United States, including Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Clinic and Stanford Health Care.</p>

    <h3>We Believe</h3>
    <p>We believe in evidence-based practice and providing support for all health care providers.  We also believe even the best designed randomized/placebo-controlled study can be undermined by a skewed participant pool (self-selection bias).  Even with our research, if you believe there is an issue with any of our products, please reach out to us!  We are happy to work with you to improve our products to provide greater benefit and better patient care.</p>
