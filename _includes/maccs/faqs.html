    <h3>What is MACCs?</h3>
    <p>MACCs (pronounced "Max") is a credit card reference app to encourage healthy spending habits and help maximize your rewards.</p>

    <h3>Why MACCs?</h3>
    <p>The parents at Koala Health have various credit cards with some rewards as high as 5% on rotational categories that change every 3 months.  This is hard to track.  So, we decided to make a private, auto-updating reference.  No more looking up the new rewards from multiple sources.  No giving up on matching rewards to purchases.  Just focus on determining your "wants" vs "needs!"</p>

    <h3>What iPhone models are recommended for MACCs?</h3>
    <p>The recommended iPhones are <strong>iPhone 6S, iPhone 6S Plus, iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, iPhone X, iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, iPhone XR, iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, iPhone 11 Pro Max, iPhone 12, iPhone 12 Pro, iPhone 12 Pro Max.</strong>.  MACCs has been tested for all Apple supported iPhones running the latest version of iOS 14 (last updated: 03/13/2021).  iPhone SE and iPhones with similar screen resolutions are not recommended.  Any older iPhone generations and iPhones not running iOS 14 are also not recommended.</p>

    <h3>How does Koala Health make money?</h3>
